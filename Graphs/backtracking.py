"""
Backtracking is an algorithm for finding solutions for computation problems. It works step by step.
It builds the solution one piece at a time. while building the solution, if the solutions fails any constraints we backtrack the solution, and build the another solution.
Like this we try to build a solution that reaches the end point and satisifies all constraints.
It follows the DFS approach, explores one solution completely before backtracking to another solution

Classic examples of backtracking are 
1. N Queens
2. Sudoku Solver
3. Sub sets,
4. Premutations and combinations.
